## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

* As a website user, I can:

- As a site user, I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view.
- As a Site User / Admin, I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
- As a Site User I can register an account so that I can comment on a post.
- As a Site User I can leave comments on a post so that I can interact with the listings
- As a Site User I can modify or delete my comment on a post.
- As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage the listings.
- As a Site Admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.
- As a Site Admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.
